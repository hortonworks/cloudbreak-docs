## tl;dr

When you create a release branch (like `release-1.6.0`) and push it  to github, CircleCI will automatically generate a new directory (named as the  branch (like  release-1.6.0) in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-docs/tree/gh-pages).

So you will be able to  view that version, by modifying the version part of the url: http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak-docs/release-1.6.0/

The version dropdown box is generated from the [versions.json](https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-docs/blob/gh-pages/versions.json).

The latest label is specified in  [circle.yml](https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-docs/blob/master/circle.yml#L20)
